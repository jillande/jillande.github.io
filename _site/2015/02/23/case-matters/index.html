        <h1>Hello, world!</h1>
        <p>This is a template for a simple marketing or informational website. It includes a large callout called a jumbotron and three supporting pieces of content. Use it as a starting point to create something more unique.</p>

      <p>I sometimes see handouts or brochures and cringe when I see something like:</p>

<p>WWW.NDSU.EDU/CMS</p>

<p>(all caps). Typing a "plain text" web address in all capital letters to bring
some attention to the web address might seem like a good idea, but it really
isn't.</p>

<p>If that "plain text" finds its way from a printed document to something the
prospective visitor consumes electronically (such as an email or a document
attachment) the link you thought would get all the attention might start getting
all the attention for the wrong reasons.</p>

<p>The IT Division learns of this innocent mistake shortly thereafter, in a
scenario that sounds something like the following:</p>

<div style="margin: 2em;">
<p><em>Happy page author:</em> (Prints 1,000 brochures saying "Go to
WWW.NDSU.EDU/CMS to learn more!")</p>

<p><em>Helpful message spreader:</em> (Emails the digital copy of the brochure
to everyone in the address book so more people will know what's going on with
the department)</p>

<p>[ 20 minutes later ]</p>

<p><em>Helpful message spreader:</em> (Receives email response saying the link
doesn't work)</p>

<p> [ Panic ensues ]</p>

<p><em>Paniced message spreader:</em> (Phones the IT department) Please!
Someone help! The link I sent out to thousands of people doesn't work. I didn't
test it before I sent it out!</p>

<p><em>IT department:</em> URLs are case-sensitive. That means www.ndsu.edu/cms , www.ndsu.edu/CMS , www.ndsu.edu/Cms , www.ndsu.edu/cMs (repeat for remaining
combinations) are all different pages. You created www.ndsu.edu/cms so all of
those other combinations don't work. We only create new sites in all lowercase,
so that link will stay "broken."</p>
