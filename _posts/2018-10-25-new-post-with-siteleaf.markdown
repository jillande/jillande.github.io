I'm not sure if it's necessary to specify a path (the default may be just fine) but it is edited here.

Here's some *fancy* **Markdown** content. No WYSIWYG for you, but there are a minimal set of editor buttons to help remember the formatting. Most importantly, insert image.


First oddity: the path is horrible. It adds "/jekyll/siteleaf" to the beginning of the post path. I don't see a way to edit that.
