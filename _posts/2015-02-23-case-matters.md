I sometimes see handouts or brochures and cringe when I see something like:

WWW.NDSU.EDU/CMS

(all caps). Typing a "plain text" web address in all capital letters to bring
some attention to the web address might seem like a good idea, but it really
isn't.

If that "plain text" finds its way from a printed document to something the
prospective visitor consumes electronically (such as an email or a document
attachment) the link you thought would get all the attention might start getting
all the attention for the wrong reasons.

The IT Division learns of this innocent mistake shortly thereafter, in a
scenario that sounds something like the following:

<div style="margin: 2em;">
<p><em>Happy page author:</em> (Prints 1,000 brochures saying "Go to
WWW.NDSU.EDU/CMS to learn more!")</p>

<p><em>Helpful message spreader:</em> (Emails the digital copy of the brochure
to everyone in the address book so more people will know what's going on with
the department)</p>

<p>[ 20 minutes later ]</p>

<p><em>Helpful message spreader:</em> (Receives email response saying the link
doesn't work)</p>

<p> [ Panic ensues ]</p>

<p><em>Paniced message spreader:</em> (Phones the IT department) Please!
Someone help! The link I sent out to thousands of people doesn't work. I didn't
test it before I sent it out!</p>

<p><em>IT department:</em> URLs are case-sensitive. That means www.ndsu.edu/cms , www.ndsu.edu/CMS , www.ndsu.edu/Cms , www.ndsu.edu/cMs (repeat for remaining
combinations) are all different pages. You created www.ndsu.edu/cms so all of
those other combinations don't work. We only create new sites in all lowercase,
so that link will stay "broken."</p>
